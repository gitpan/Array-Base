NAME

Array::Base - array index offseting

DESCRIPTION

This module implements automatic offsetting of array indices.  In normal
Perl, the first element of an array has index 0, the second element has
index 1, and so on.  This module allows array indexes to start at some
other value.  Most commonly it is used to give the first element of an
array the index 1 (and the second 2, and so on), to imitate the indexing
behaviour of FORTRAN and many other languages.  It is usually considered
poor style to do this.

The array index offset is controlled at compile time, in a
lexically-scoped manner.  Each block of code, therefore, is subject to
a fixed offset.  It is expected that the affected code is written with
knowledge of what that offset is.

version 0.004; 2011-07-27

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Lexical::SealRequireHints (for
    working around [perl #73174])

  * document that Perls prior to 5.9.3 don't propagate the right lexical
    state into string eval

version 0.003; 2011-04-09

  * bugfix: correctly detect a type of malformed op tree that the module
    can't process

  * document that $[ is now due to disappear in Perl 5.15, changed
    from 5.13

  * on Perl 5.13.6+, use new API function op_contextualize() instead of
    the core's private functions

  * in XS, use PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT for efficiency

  * in XS, declare "PROTOTYPES: DISABLE" to prevent automatic generation
    of unintended prototypes

  * jump through hoops to avoid compiler warnings

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * in test suite, make all numeric comparisons against $] stringify it
    first, to avoid architecture-dependent problems with floating point
    rounding giving it an unexpected numeric value

  * in Build.PL, complete declaration of configure-time requirements

  * include META.json in distribution

  * add MYMETA.json to .cvsignore

version 0.002; 2010-04-11

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Lexical::SealRequireHints (for
    passing package through to required code in pure-Perl version of
    Lexical::SealRequireHints)

  * in XS, use macros to avoid explicit passing of aTHX, in the manner
    of the core

  * in XS, avoid using "class" as a variable name, for compatibility
    with C++ compilers

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  * add MYMETA.yml to .cvsignore

version 0.001; 2009-10-21

  * bugfix: correct behaviour of array slicing in scalar context

  * bugfix: also influence list slicing and array splicing, as $[ does

  * for Perl 5.11, also influence the new array keys() and each()
    operators

  * reorganise documentation, particularly expanding the comparison
    with $[

  * use integer arithmetic operators for efficiency

  * test all combinations of scalar and list contexts

  * in documentation, correct statement about when $[ is likely to be
    removed from the core

  * split test suite into one file per affected opcode

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

version 0.000; 2009-09-27

  * initial released version
